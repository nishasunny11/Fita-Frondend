    <P>Please don't skip this 1-minute read.<br> 
    I'm sorry to interrupt, but our fundraiser won’t last long.<br>
    This Saturday, 16 September, I humbly request you to reflect on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the past year, the value you got from it, and whether you're able to contribute ₹ 25.<br> 
    If you can, kindly join the 2% of readers who donate.<br>
    If everyone reading this right now gave ₹ 25, we'd reach our goal in a couple of hours.<br>
    When I set up the Wikimedia Foundation as a nonprofit to host Wikipedia and 12 other free knowledge projects, it meant that we could preserve our core values: neutral, high quality information, not outrage and sensationalism.<br><br>
    Being a nonprofit means there is no danger that someone will buy Wikipedia and turn it into their personal space.</P>
